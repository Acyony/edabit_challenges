No one can become perfect in just one day, we need practice, practice, and practice.

Paulo Coelho says that to become good at anything, we have to practice and repeat, practice and repeat until the technique becomes intuitive.

This is what I have been trying to do. Practicing every day a little bit, staying focused, learning, and improving my skills.

To keep me even more motivated, I will share with you some exercises that I have been doing in Edabit. I hope I can contribute a little bit to your studies as well.

Feel free to share your solutions too.
